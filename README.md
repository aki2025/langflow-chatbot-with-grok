# langflow-chatbot-with-groq
Langflow is a low-code tool for developers that makes it easier to build powerful AI agents and workflows that can use any API, model, or database.

langflow chatbot with grok- this repo provide a basic langchain - langflow chatbot work with groq LLM. this code help to understad a simple chatbot promt flow using langflow. Prompts serve as the inputs to a large language model (LLM), acting as the interface between human instructions and computational tasks. By submitting natural language requests in a prompt to an LLM, you can obtain answers, generate text, and solve problems.

API- Generate the code to integrate your flow into an external application. API calls require an Application Token to authenticate your request.

LangFlow: Overview
LangFlow is an open-source platform that allows users to build, customize, and experiment with LangChain applications visually. LangChain is a popular framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs), and LangFlow makes it easier to design and manage workflows without writing extensive code.

Key Features of LangFlow
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Provides a user-friendly, visual environment to design workflows for LLM-based applications.
LangChain Integration: Seamlessly integrates with LangChain, enabling the use of LLMs, chains, memory, agents, and tools directly.
Custom Nodes:Offers prebuilt nodes (e.g., LLMs, prompts, tools) that can be configured and linked to create complex workflows.
Debugging Capabilities:Facilitates debugging by allowing users to test workflows and see real-time outputs from LLMs.
Extensibility:Users can add custom components, making it flexible for advanced use cases.
Open Source:Fully open source, allowing developers to contribute, modify, and deploy locally or in the cloud.


This code demonstrates how to use Langflow's prompt tools to issue basic prompts to an LLM, and how various prompting strategies can affect your outcomes.
